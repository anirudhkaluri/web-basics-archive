                This is a paragraph in div tag 2. Since it is p tag inside a div tag it will be styled with the style rule
                div p{} in styles3.css just like the above paragraph in division section1.
            </p>
            <span class="dummy">
                This is a span tag which is in another division section. Say this is division section 2. 
                Since class is dummy, it will be styled just like the list in division section 1.
